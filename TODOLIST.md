# TODOLIST

## Audio

* Consider text-to-speech as an alternative to audio recorded sounds
* Add small sounds for a quiet mode (board active / inactive)

## Energy saving

* Use preview frame rather than take a picture to compute the ambiant light

## Board configuration

* Add a supplementary fixed layout on each board

## Interactions

* Refactor Gesture Detector independantly on each button. Does it work with multiple touch?.
* Add a way to activate the sound of a pictogram using a long touch without moving the finger (~ 1 second ?)
* Use QRcodes to detect the incoming board

## Preferences

* Show/hide preferences depending on another value (detect board -> delays). Is it possible ?
* Add a list of pre-configured screen sizes, and a custom mode to measure it
* Add a reset to default button on each subpart of the preferences. Is it possible ?

## Customization

* Create a website to create board, with template depending on tablets. The user can drag&drop image and audio recording in each of the cells, can give all the required names (board name, pictogram name, etc). A "generate" button produces a zip to be loaded in the application, and a pdf ready to print for the physical board.
